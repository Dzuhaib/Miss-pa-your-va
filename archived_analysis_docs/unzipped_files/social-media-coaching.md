## Main Introduction

As a multi award-winning social media coach with over five years of experience as a marketing manager, I've had the privilege of working with large hotel brands, busy events, and inspiring entrepreneurs across the UK, including beauty salons, wellness studios, and aesthetics clinics.

One thing I've learned is that there's no one-size-fits-all when it comes to growing a business online. Every brand is different, and that's exactly why my social media coaching for beauty businesses is built entirely around you.

Through bespoke 121 training, I'll give you the clarity, confidence, and tailored strategies you need to master social media and start seeing real results. Whether it's growing your followers, boosting engagement, or finally turning your content into paying clients, I break it all down step by step with actionable advice that feels simple and doable.

## Why Coaching (Background)

Feeling overwhelmed by social media but not quite ready to invest in full management? Do you struggle with content planning, organisation, or crafting engaging captions? Do you find yourself wondering how other businesses seem to effortlessly thrive online?

The secret often lies in investing in knowledge and guidance. If you're posting randomly just to maintain consistency but lacking a clear strategy, our social media coaching services are designed for you. We'll help you navigate the ever-changing algorithms and equip you with the skills and knowledge to create a powerful social media presence.
