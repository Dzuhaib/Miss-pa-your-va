## All FAQ Questions & Full Answers

---

### 1. Do I get to approve posts before they go live?

You can if you'd like — but most of our clients leave us to it so they can stay totally stress-free. We share your content plan (Monday to Monday) in Airtable with an easy approval checkbox and a comments section, so you can tick, tweak, or add notes on anything you'd like changed.

---

### 2. Who creates the content?

We do! From graphics and captions to planning and scheduling, we take care of it all (depending on your package). However, you're responsible for providing the raw content — such as photos, videos, or any behind-the-scenes clips — so we can build a strategy that truly reflects your business. We'll then use those assets (along with your brand colours, fonts, and tone of voice) to create polished, professional, engaging content that feels personal and authentic to you.

---

### 3. What if I don't have brand guidelines?

No worries! We'll help you create a simple brand kit during onboarding — colours, fonts, and tone of voice — so your socials always look and sound consistent.

---

### 4. Do you reply to comments and DMs?

This depends on your package. Our **Super Hero package** includes full DM management, while all other packages include small amounts of organic engagement (liking, commenting, and light interaction) to help boost visibility. We'll confirm exactly what's included in your package during onboarding so everything feels clear.

---

### 5. How often will I hear from you?

You'll get regular updates and reports (bi-monthly as standard), plus we're available via email or WhatsApp for quick check-ins whenever you need us.

---

### 6. What's included in reporting?

We keep it simple: reach, engagement, clicks, and growth. No jargon — just clear insights into what's working, what's not, and how we'll keep moving forward.

---

### 7. Do you follow best practices?

Yes — we follow best practices recommended by **Meta for Business** to ensure your content stays engaging and algorithm-friendly. We bring a real, human feel to your marketing so your audience connects with you — and that connection can lead to sales.

---

### 8. What platforms do you manage?

We manage Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and more — depending on your package and your target audience.

---

### 9. Can you help with paid ads?

Yes. We work with Meta Ads Manager for targeted Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns, and we can advise on whether boosted posts or full ad campaigns suit your goals best.

---

### 10. Are social media managers responsible for sales?

No — our role isn't direct selling. Instead, we help your brand look professional, gain visibility, and show up in the best light. We bring a real, human feel to your marketing so your audience connects with you — and that connection can lead to sales.

---

### 11. What if I want to cancel early?

Let's be real — you'll never want to cancel (I've had clients stick with me for over 5 years!)… but if you do:

We require **1 month's notice**, as agreed in your contract. Notice must be put in writing via email, with the subject line **"Contract Termination"**. Please include:
- Your name & business name
- The package you're on
- Your intended final date of service

During that notice period, we'll continue supporting you and begin the offboarding process — winding down posts, preparing final reports, and making sure you're never left in the lurch.
