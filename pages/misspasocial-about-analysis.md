### Page-Specific Images (referenced / expected on About page)

The About page is expected to include one or more of the following based on typical About page structure and what has been indexed. However, these could not be confirmed from the raw HTML source due to server fetch limitations:

| # | Likely Asset | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 3 | Claire.jpg — `/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Claire.jpg` | Claire's professional portrait — used on homepage About section, very likely also used on the About page |
| 4 | awards.webp — `/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/awards.webp` | Award imagery — referenced in About content context, may appear as credential visual |
| 5 | Unknown hero/banner image | The About page likely has a hero banner image or background image — not confirmed from indexed content |

> ⚠️ Note: The raw HTML source of the About page could not be directly fetched. Images listed above under "page-specific" are inferred from indexed content and sitewide asset patterns. Full confirmation would require direct HTML access.

---

## 13. ALL VIDEO ASSETS

No video assets were confirmed as present on the About page from available indexed content.

The About page does not appear to use background video (unlike the Social Media Coaching and Virtual Assistant Services pages which use `social-media.mp4` and `file.mp4` respectively).

### Colour Palette (Sitewide — consistent with homepage)

| Colour Name | Approx Hex | Usage |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Jet Black | #000000 | Primary dark section backgrounds |
| Warm Gold | ~#C8A96E | Accent headings, highlights, buttons |
| Pure White | #FFFFFF | Body text on dark backgrounds |
| Charcoal | ~#1A1A1A | Secondary dark backgrounds |
| Off-White / Light Grey | ~#F5F5F5 | Light section backgrounds |
| Mid Grey | ~#666666 | Secondary / muted text |

### Typography (Sitewide — consistent)

| Role | Style | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| H1 / Page Title | Serif display (Playfair Display or similar) | High-end, editorial feel |
| H2 / H3 Subheadings | Serif or bold sans-serif | Consistent with homepage |
| Body Copy | Clean sans-serif (DM Sans or similar) | Readable, lightweight |
| Credentials / labels | Bold uppercase / sans-serif | Used for qualification labels |

### Design Style Notes
- **Dark luxury aesthetic** with gold accents — consistent with homepage
- **Single-column layout** for the main body content on this page (no multi-column split evident from indexed content — though the homepage About section is 2-column)
- **Credentials section** likely rendered as a horizontal pill/badge row or vertical list
- **No hero video** on this page — text-led page
- **Section rhythm:** Light intro → Services overview → Personal story → Credentials → CTA — logical trust-building sequence

---

## 17. CONTENT ISSUES & NOTES

### 🔴 Critical Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | "Free masterclass" linked with no visible URL | Social Media Coaching section | A free masterclass is referenced ("Be sure to check out our free masterclass for a taster of what we offer!") but no hyperlink is confirmed. Visitors are encouraged to check it out with no way to find it. Likely intended to link to Stan Store or Membership page. |
| 2 | Old trading name used in copy | Founder Statement section | The text references "Claire's Business Support" — the original business name, not the current brand "Miss PA Your VA" or "Miss PA Social". This creates brand confusion and looks like outdated copy that was never updated. |

### 🟡 Medium Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 3 | No testimonials or social proof on the About page | Entire page | The About page is a key trust-building page — it should feature client quotes, star ratings, or a testimonial pull-out. None are confirmed. The Testimonials page exists separately but nothing is pulled through to About. |
| 4 | Awards mentioned sitewide but not prominently displayed here | Qualifications section | The site claims 6 awards in 2024 and 2 in 2020, but the About page doesn't appear to call these out prominently with visuals or a dedicated awards section — despite this being the most relevant page for that credential. |
| 5 | No named sub-headings for each service | Services Overview section | The four services are listed but without clear H2/H3 headings making them scannable. On a page where visitors are evaluating whether to hire, clarity and scannability are critical. |
| 6 | "Contact me today for a free consultation" — not a button | Founder Statement | This is written as plain body text rather than a styled CTA button. A missed conversion opportunity buried in a paragraph. |

### 🟢 Minor Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 7 | Meta description is very thin | Page `<head>` | "Virtual Assistant and Social Media Management in Devon and UK to help your business grow online with Miss PA Your VA." — only 109 characters. Could be richer with more specific value proposition and keywords. |
| 8 | No schema markup | SEO | No LocalBusiness, Person, or ProfessionalService schema detected — a significant missed SEO opportunity on the About page specifically. |
| 9 | Footer logo has no alt text | Footer | MPYV-WHITETEXT-4K.png has an empty alt attribute — accessibility issue consistent across the whole site. |
| 10 | "Visit our store" and "Money Mindset Mamas" don't open in new tab | Header | External links that navigate users away from the site without warning — minor UX issue consistent sitewide. |
| 11 | No team photos beyond Claire | About page | If the brand refers to "our team" and "we" throughout, but only Claire is named and photographed, this can create a credibility gap if prospects are curious about who else is involved. |

### ℹ️ Observations

| # | Observation | Detail |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 12 | Services on About page differ slightly from nav | The About page lists "Content Creation" as a standalone service, but the navigation lists "Content Filming" — these appear to be the same service described with different names. Inconsistency across pages. |
| 13 | Time-saving claim is specific and strong | "15–30 hours per week" saved by outsourcing social media is a concrete, compelling claim. This should be used more prominently across the site — it's buried in the About page and not visible on the homepage. |
| 14 | "Invisible hand" metaphor is distinctive | "your invisible hand" used in the founder statement is a memorable and differentiated brand phrase. It doesn't appear to be used consistently across other pages — worth propagating if it resonates with the target audience. |
