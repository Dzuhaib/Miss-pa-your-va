**Total external links on page: 10**

> ⚠️ Critical Issue: Links 6, 7, and 8 (from the Services Feature Block) all point to the web developer's site (Impress Web) rather than to Miss PA's own service pages. This sends prospective clients to a completely unrelated third-party website. These appear to be placeholder links left over from a website template and were never corrected.

## 17. CONTENT ISSUES & NOTES

The following issues were identified during the analysis:

### 🔴 Critical Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Wrong CTA destination | Hero Slider — Slide 2 | "Learn More" for Content Filming links to `/about/` not `/services/content-filming/` |
| 2 | All 3 feature block CTAs link externally | Services Feature Block | "Find out more" on Beauty & Aesthetics, Award Winning, and Bespoke & Stunning all link to the web developer's website (Impress Web) — not to Miss PA's own service pages |

### 🟡 Medium Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 3 | Content Filming missing from Services Link Block | Section 5 | Only 4 of 5 services listed — Content Filming is absent |
| 4 | Blog post images 7, 8, 10 have blank alt text | Blog Section | Missing alt text = accessibility and SEO miss |
| 5 | Blog post image title is a GUID | Blog Post 2 | Title: 359d764b-b1d6-4ccb-ae69-b7660170be80 — not descriptive |
| 6 | Blog post image titled IMG_7320 | Blog Post 5 | Raw iPhone filename — never renamed on upload |

### 🟢 Minor Issues

| # | Issue | Location | Detail |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 8 | "Visit our store" and "Money Mindset Mamas" don't open in new tab | Header | External links that navigate away from the page without warning |
| 9 | H1 is not the page title | Page Structure | Page `<title>` is "Beauty Business Marketing in Devon - Miss PA Your VA" but H1 is "Marketing & Virtual Assistant Team for beauty businesses in Devon" — slightly inconsistent keyword targeting |
| 10 | No schema/structured data | SEO | No LocalBusiness, Organization, or Service schema markup found |
| 11 | No testimonials/social proof on homepage | Conversion | The homepage has no client quotes, star ratings, or trust badges above the fold or in the main content |
| 12 | Blog images all lazy-loaded with SVG placeholders | Performance | Correct for performance, but means image URLs are not visible in raw HTML source |
