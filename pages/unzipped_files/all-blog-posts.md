**Title:** Boosted Posts vs Facebook Ads – What's the Difference?
**URL:** /2025/10/15/boosted-posts-vs-facebook-ads-whats-the-difference/
**Published:** 15 October 2025
**Category:** Marketing
**Meta Description:** Boosted posts and Facebook ads work differently. Learn which one brings real results for beauty & aesthetics businesses in Devon and the UK.

**Full Content Summary:**

Many beauty and aesthetics business owners wonder about the difference between boosted posts and Facebook ads. If you're a business owner in beauty, aesthetics, or wellness, you've probably clicked that little blue "Boost Post" button on Facebook or Instagram and wondered… is this the same as running Facebook Ads? It's not. Knowing the difference can be the key to whether your marketing budget brings you new clients or just a few extra likes.

**Boosted Posts:**
- Take an existing post from your Facebook or Instagram page and pay to show it to more people
- Quick and easy — ideal for increasing visibility or engagement
- Perfect for brand awareness or time-sensitive content (events, last-minute offers)
- Like putting your content on a billboard — more people see it, but it doesn't always lead to action
- Limited targeting options

**Facebook Ads (via Meta Ads Manager):**
- Fully customisable with powerful targeting options
- Measurable results and deeper analytics
- Choose specific objectives: lead generation, website traffic, sales, etc.
- Like a tailored marketing campaign — reaching the right people, not just more people
- Requires more setup but delivers better ROI for client acquisition

**Audience:** Beauty, aesthetics, and wellness business owners in Devon and across the UK.

**Title:** What Should I Post as a Beauty & Aesthetics Business Owner to Attract More Clients?
**URL:** /2025/10/01/what-should-i-post-as-a-beauty-aesthetics-business-owner-to-attract-more-clients/
**Published:** 1 October 2025
**Category:** Social Media
**Meta Description:** Discover the best beauty social media content ideas to attract more clients. Perfect for aesthetics clinics in Devon and across the UK.

**Full Content Summary:**

Content ideas that actually attract clients for beauty and aesthetics businesses:

1. **Before & After Transformations** — The OG of aesthetics content for a reason. Showcasing before-and-after results (with client consent) instantly builds trust and shows off your skills. Clients love to see results, not just read about them.

2. **Educational FAQs & Aftercare Tips** — Quick, engaging posts that answer FAQs ("Does it hurt?" / "How long does it last?") or explain aftercare tips are gold. Position yourself as the go-to expert; your audience feels smarter for following you. Win-win.

3. **Behind the Scenes** — People don't just buy treatments; they buy into you. Share peeks of your clinic, your team, your coffee-fuelled mornings, or even the calm after a busy day. Makes your brand feel approachable and premium at the same time.

4. **Social Proof / Testimonials** — Nothing sells like social proof. Share client testimonials, reviews, or user-generated content — word-of-mouth marketing amplified on Instagram and TikTok.

5. **Relatable & Trending Content** — Memes, trending audios, and relatable "if you know, you know" content makes your brand memorable and shareable. Example: *"When you only booked Botox for your frown lines but suddenly want the whole face done…"*

**Resources mentioned:** Instagram for Business (for insight into trends)
